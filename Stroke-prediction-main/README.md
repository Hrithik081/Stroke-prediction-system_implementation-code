# Stroke-prediction 
The Stroke Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the risk of 
stroke based on health and lifestyle data. The system uses various input parameters such as age, gender,
 hypertension, heart disease, and others to assist healthcare professionals in assessing stroke risk.
